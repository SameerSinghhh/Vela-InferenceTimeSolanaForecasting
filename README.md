# 🧠 Inference-Time LLM Forecasting for Solana (SOL)

## Project Overview

This project builds a novel inference-time LLM forecasting tool that predicts the future price of Solana (SOL) using only inference-time memory (i.e., no training of model weights). The goal is to incrementally "teach" the LLM to reason better by feeding it summaries of previous examples — including what it predicted, what actually happened, and a reflection on why it was wrong — as context at test time.

## Key Innovation

All learning happens at **inference time** through two forms of memory:
- **Short-term memory (STM):** A few most relevant prior examples retrieved based on similarity to the current test case
- **Long-term memory (LTM):** A stored database of all prior training examples (predictions, actual values, summaries, reflections, etc.)

## Setup

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:

```bash
# Create .env file
cat > .env << EOF
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
SERP_API_KEY=your_serp_api_key_here
SERP_BASE_URL=https://csearch.vela.partners/search
EOF
```

### Dependencies
```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv openai beautifulsoup4 lxml newspaper3k requests-html selenium webdriver-manager fake-useragent
```

**⚠️ Security Note:** Never commit API keys to git! The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`.
