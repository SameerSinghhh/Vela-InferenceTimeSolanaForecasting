On July 28, Solana surpassed Ethereum in weekly fees, earning approximately $25 million versus $21 million.

A moderate weekly increase of about 10-12% aligns with both the bullish fundamentals and the possibility of future ETF-related interest.","This prediction was wrong because, despite the technical support and anticipated ETF-driven demand, the actual market conditions were more volatile than expected, and the bullish fundamentals did not materialize immediately, resulting in a price drop rather than an increase. Additionally, the reasoning did not sufficiently account for the inherent high volatility in the crypto market, which led to the forecast missing the reversal that pushed SOL below the predicted range."

This prediction also factors in SOL's historical volatility, which typically ranges between 10-30% in a short period.","The prediction was off because it leaned too heavily on bullish sentiment from the VanEck report and assumed that upward technical trends would continuously prevail, while underestimating short-term market volatility and potential corrections. In reality, Solana's price experienced a decline, suggesting that the analysis did not fully account for the inherent unpredictability and broader market pressures that can reverse such trends almost as quickly."

In August, SOL dropped to $130 and later climbed to $168, and today it trades near $163.93.
